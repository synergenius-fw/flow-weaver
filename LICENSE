## Acceptance

By using the software, you agree to all of the terms and conditions below.

## Copyright License

The licensor grants you a non-exclusive, royalty-free, worldwide,
non-sublicensable, non-transferable license to use, copy, distribute, make
available, and prepare derivative works of the software, in each case subject to
the limitations and conditions below.

## Limitations

You may not provide the software to third parties as a hosted or managed
service, where the service provides users with access to any of the features or
functionality of the software.

You may not use the software to build, distribute, or offer any product, tool,
or service that provides a graphical or visual interface for creating, editing,
designing, or composing workflows. This restriction applies whether the product
is hosted, distributed, sold, or offered free of charge.

You may not sell the software or any product whose value is substantially derived
from the functionality of the software, without a separate commercial license
from the licensor.

You may not move, change, disable, or circumvent the license key functionality
in the software, and you may not remove or obscure any functionality in the
software that is protected by the license key.

Derivative works must retain all license key functionality, license verification
mechanisms, and licensing notices present in the original software. Distributing
derivative works with license key protections removed, disabled, or bypassed
constitutes a violation of this license.

You may not alter, remove, or obscure any licensing, copyright, or other notices
of the licensor in the software. Any use of the licensor's trademarks is subject
to applicable law.

## Patents

The licensor grants you a license, under any patent claims the licensor can
license, or becomes able to license, to make, have made, use, sell, offer for
sale, import and have imported the software, in each case subject to the
limitations and conditions in this license. This license does not cover any
patent claims that you cause to be infringed by modifications or additions to the
software. If you or your company make any written claim that the software
infringes or contributes to infringement of any patent, your patent license for
the software granted under these terms ends immediately. If your company makes
such a claim, your patent license ends immediately for work on behalf of your
company.

## Notices

You must ensure that anyone who gets a copy of any part of the software from you
also gets a copy of these terms.

If you modify the software, you must include in any modified copies of the
software prominent notices stating that you have modified the software.

## No Other Rights

These terms do not imply any licenses other than those expressly granted in
these terms.

## Termination

If you use the software in violation of these terms, such use is not licensed,
and your licenses will automatically terminate. If the licensor provides you
with a notice of your violation, and you cease all violation of this license no
later than 30 days after you receive that notice, your licenses will be
reinstated retroactively. However, if you violate these terms after such
reinstatement, any additional violation of these terms will cause your licenses
to terminate immediately.

You may request a review of any termination by contacting the licensor in
writing within 15 days of termination. The licensor will respond within 30 days.

## No Liability

As far as the law allows, the software comes as is, without any warranty or
condition, and the licensor will not be liable to you for any damages arising
out of these terms or the use or nature of the software, under any kind of
legal claim.

## Governing Law

This license is governed by the laws of Portugal. Any disputes arising from or
related to this license will be submitted to the exclusive jurisdiction of the
courts of Lisbon, Portugal.

## Definitions

The "licensor" is Ricardo Jose Horta Morais (Synergenius), and the "software"
is the software the licensor makes available under these terms.

"You" refers to the individual or entity agreeing to these terms. "Your company"
is any legal entity, sole proprietorship, or other kind of organization that you
work for, plus all organizations that have control over, are under the control
of, or are under common control with that organization. "Control" means
ownership of substantially all the assets of an entity, or the power to direct
its management and policies by vote, contract, or otherwise. Control can be
direct or indirect.

"Third parties" means any individual or entity that is not you or your company
as defined in these terms.

"Your licenses" are all the licenses granted to you for the software under these
terms. "Use" means anything you do with the software requiring one of your
licenses.

"Hosting the software" means making the software's functionality available to
users over a network as a service. Running the software in automated build
pipelines, continuous integration systems, command-line interfaces, or
development toolchains does not constitute hosting, regardless of organization
size.

ADDITIONAL NOTICES

1. Output of the Software

The output of the software, including but not limited to compiled workflows,
generated code, deployment artifacts, and any other files produced by the
software's compilation, code generation, or export features, is not considered
part of the software and may be used, copied, modified, distributed, and
sublicensed for any purpose without restriction under this license.

2. Internal Hosting Threshold

Organizations with 15 or fewer individuals, including employees, contractors,
and affiliates, may host the software on internal infrastructure for use by
their members without restriction under this license. The count includes all
individuals in the organization, not only those who directly use the software.

Organizations with more than 15 individuals that wish to host the software,
whether on internal infrastructure or as a service, require a commercial
license.

3. Unrestricted Use

Using the software locally, including installing, running, compiling workflows,
generating code, and producing deployment artifacts, is permitted for any
individual or organization regardless of size, subject to the Limitations above.

4. Export Compliance

You are responsible for compliance with all applicable export and import laws
and regulations in your jurisdiction when using, distributing, or making the
software available.
